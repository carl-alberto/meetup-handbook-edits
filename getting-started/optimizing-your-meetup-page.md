There are two universal questions people ask themselves when deciding whether to join your meetup. The first is **‘ARE they Like me?** The second question is **‘WILL they like me?’**  

So when someone is looking at a meetup page, their choice to attend an event will be influenced by whether what they see about your group seems as if it will ‘fit’ them. and whether they continue to attend will depend a lot on how they’re received when they come to your group.

### ARE they like Me?

The first opportunity we have to make an impression and demonstrate to new inquirers what your group members are like it starts with your Meetup page.

#### About Pages

Your About Page is where you have the first opportunity to introduce your purpose or goal. This is where you put your mission statement and where you should be very clear about what you’re about. It may not just be enough to say “we’re a group about WordPress.” If however, you say “we’re WordPress users who teach and learn from each other, who enjoy sharing knowledge, and who are passionate about encouraging others into WordPress and Open Source’” you’re introducing both the mission to advance WordPress but also the inclusive nature of the kinds of people who will be at an event.

If you're interested in a template for that page you can edit and adjust for your own group, [you can find that here](resources/aboutpage.md)

#### Custom About pages on Meetup

In addition to the main about section on meetup you have tools available to create [custom pages](resources/specificmeetupinfo.md) to give more detailed information about your group. This is also where you are able to create a page for your [code of conduct](resources/codeofconduct.md) that gives people clear information about what you expect of group members and the kind of environment WordPress Meetups are expected to provide.

#### Member Profiles

The second area you have available to make great impressions on people are your member profile pages. On meetup you have an opportunity to ask people questions about themselves and while we often use those questions as organisers to help inform us as to what people want from the meetup, they’re also really valuable for people to get more information about the kind of members they’ll meet when they come to your event.

In wanting to stay as inclusive as possible, these are not a requirement to people joining the group, but for those who do answer (and we’ve found that most do) they give a great window to outsiders looking to come in. Here are some good leading questions. (Choose one or two)

1.   What would you like to learn about WordPress?
2.   How are you already using WordPress?


#### Photo Gallery

Have a photo gallery that really helps showcase your events. Use your top level meetup gallery to showcase good quality, clear and informative welcoming photos of your group! (not grainy low quality phone photos)

#### Welcome Email

Finally, the welcome email is a really great way of introducing your group to new members when they’ve taken the plunge and actually joined but have not yet attended an event. It is an excellent opportunity to introduce yourselves a bit more personally to new members.
