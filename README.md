# meetup-handbook-edits

This is a repo of suggested edits and updates to the WordPress Meetup Handbook available over on https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/

It is by no means exhaustive, but I believe provides a coherent flow and structure to make starting a meetup, or finding resources for growing your meetup once it's established.

Please add, edit, update as you see fit.
