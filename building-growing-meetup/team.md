### Having a Great Organizing Team

Being an organizing team of one can be an enormous amount of work, so if you're planning to grow and develop your group you'll need others around help spread the load. Here are some tips to identifying people who may be great assets to your meetup group.

1.  They are team players and are always around
2.  They help without asking
3.  They may be the first to arrive and the last to leave
4.  They participate
5.  They may be keen to organize meetups around their area of interest in WordPress

Quality team members may not be the loudest most obvious person there, but the quiet achievers who are loyal and regular attendees are obviously getting a lot out of meetup and could be quietly encouraged to take more of an organizing role.
