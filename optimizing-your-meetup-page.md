There are two universal questions people ask themselves when deciding whether to join your meetup. The first is **‘ARE they Like me?** The second question is **‘WILL they like me?’**  

So when someone is looking at a meetup page, their choice to attend an event will be influenced by whether what they see about your group seems as if it will ‘fit’ them. and whether they continue to attend will depend a lot on how they’re received when they come to your group.

### ARE they like Me?

The first opportunity we have to make an impression and demonstrate to new inquirers what your group members are like it starts with your Meetup page.

#### About Pages

Your About Page is where you have the first opportunity to introduce your purpose or goal. This is where you put your mission statement and where you should be very clear about what you’re about. It may not just be enough to say “we’re a group about WordPress.” If however, you say “we’re WordPress users who teach and learn from each other, who enjoy sharing knowledge, and who are passionate about encouraging others into WordPress and Open Source’” you’re introducing both the mission to advance WordPress but also the inclusive nature of the kinds of people who will be at an event.

If you're interested in a template for that page you can edit and adjust for your own group, [you can find that here](resources/aboutpage.md)

#### Custom About pages on Meetup

In addition to the main about section on meetup you have tools available to create [custom pages](resources/specificmeetupinfo.md) to give more detailed information about your group. This is also where you are able to create a page for your [code of conduct](resources/codeofconduct.md) that gives people clear information about what you expect of group members and the kind of environment WordPress Meetups are expected to provide.

#### Member Profiles

The second area you have available to make great impressions on people are your member profile pages. On meetup you have an opportunity to ask people questions about themselves and while we often use those questions as organisers to help inform us as to what people want from the meetup, they’re also really valuable for people to get more information about the kind of members they’ll meet when they come to your event.

In wanting to stay as inclusive as possible, these are not a requirement to people joining the group, but for those who do answer (and we’ve found that most do) they give a great window to outsiders looking to come in. Here are some good leading questions. (Choose one or two)

1.   What would you like to learn about WordPress?
2.   How are you already using WordPress?


#### Photo Gallery

Have a photo gallery that really helps showcase your events. Use your top level meetup gallery to showcase good quality, clear and informative welcoming photos of your group! (not grainy low quality phone photos)

#### Welcome Email

Finally, the welcome email is a really great way of introducing your group to new members when they’ve taken the plunge and actually joined but have not yet attended an event. It is an excellent opportunity to introduce yourselves a bit more personally to new members.

### WILL they like me?

When was the last time you went somewhere for the first time? Do you remember how it feels to walk awkwardly into a room where you don’t know anyone? I believe that as organisers we need to stay in touch with that feeling. It makes us much better at identifying newcomers and introducing ourselves to them, and introducing them to others and making them feel important, valued, and welcome.

#### Facilitating a feeling of Welcome

I think that on the night of the event we need at least one social butterfly who meets and chats to everyone, who can spot a stranger from a distance and isn’t afraid to introduce themselves. Now, I’m fully aware that this doesn’t always come naturally and it may not be something that comes naturally to you…. so this is where having a team running a meetup comes into play. Having a team member who’s a real connector can be a great asset in helping be the glue that brings people on and helps them stay connected. So if it’s not easy for you to be that person, identify someone in the group for whom it does come easy and encourage them into a role where they’re your meetup group’s ‘welcome wagon’.

One of the ways we have to help facilitate that welcome and to bring people together is to provide food and drink for a social time before we get into the meetup program itself. For our two main metro meetups we start the evening with a half hour long social catchup and chit chat with pizza provided by a sponsor. This creates a great opportunity for people to get to know each other in a relaxed way. We also have time after the meetup to go for a drink at a local pub and while not everyone joins us for that, it has proven to be a really valuable space for people to forge some really great friendships and collaboration opportunities. If we can create the environment and atmosphere that fosters that feeling in our members, our meetups will be warm and welcoming and will grow. So, if it’s pizza and drinks, or just coffee and cake, there’s huge benefit in providing this social lubrication. How are we going to pay for it? Well, you can ask your members to make donations, or find a sponsor. We’ll talk about that in more detail a bit later. So, now that you have a group humming along and all is going well… You’ve been running a meetup for a while, you have a committed core group of people who make others welcome and encourage participation on all levels and you’re trying to keep the momentum going… what are some of the keys to making that happen?

### Having a Great Team

The 5 people circled are our awesome WordPress Melbourne organising team. I know we’re incredibly lucky to have so many people who are excited and enthusiastic about WordPress in our area. We’ve become pretty close friends over the years. This has its benefits for our group, but it has its downfalls as well…

When you have a leadership group that is tight - it can be a challenge to be open to working with new people and if it’s currently working really well, the team may not be looking for opportunities to include other people. So one of the early challenges for the team is to hold on lightly to our responsibilities and to always be on the look out for enthusiastic people who might just need some gentle encouragement to also come aboard. So how do you identify great team members and potential organisers?

1.  Team players are always around,
2.  They help without asking
3.  They may be the first to arrive and the last to leave
4.  They participate
5.  They may be keen to organise meetups around their area of interest in WordPress

Quality team members may not be the loudest most obvious person there, but the quiet achievers who are loyal and regular attendees are obviously getting a lot out of meetup and could be quietly encouraged to take more of an organising role. They may not put their hand up, but they may really be excited to be asked. So keep your eyes on the group and encourage people to be involved. We’ve had a bit of change in the make up of our team of late, and as it happens we’ve had a couple of people in the group volunteer to help. So we included them in the latest organiser team meeting, without any obligation on their part, giving them a chance to to hang out, meet the organisers and decide if they wanted to join us. When someone does volunteer? Don’t forget about them, take them at their word, and give them opportunities. And don’t forget, we want to give people as much opportunity as they want to take! Anyone can organise a meetup and can organise any kind of meetup, it doesn’t have to fit the format, timeline or structure of what we do normally. The WP community is inclusive and open and everyone is welcome to participate. When it comes to meetup, one of the great things about having a great team is being able to spread the load at a practical level For our Developer meetup we have set roles and share them around month by month. Organising Speakers/Theme for the month Being the host, introducing the speakers, doing the announcements Organising the Pizza and the News slideshow Cleaning up after supper Managing those tasks and responsibilities happens with a few really useful tools.

1.  We have a Melbourne Organisers channel on the WP Australia Slack account, and a lot of our planning happens there where we keep everyone in the loop about where things are at for the month, what’s news and what’s coming up.
2.  We use Trello to manage our tasks, take notes of inspiration for events and presentations, and suggestions of people to invite to speak, and to keep track of what’s happening month to month.
3.  We use WordPress for our website (of course), Meetup for event planning and Twitter for marketing (though it’s becoming less well used of late and we may have to rethink our strategy there)
4.  We also use hangouts for online meetups and meetings - we actually have a small group of people in WordPress businesses who have a monthly virtual meetup to help support and inspire each other in business that has members attending from all over Australia.
