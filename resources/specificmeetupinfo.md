The [developer meetup] caters to people who want to get a little more technical with their WordPress knowledge. Developers who are developing themes and plugins for WordPress, who are building client sites, and who are excited by the idea of getting deeper into the WordPress ecosystem.

We also often cover issues of business ownership, marketing and freelancing as a large contingent of our membership are running freelance business and small agencies doing WordPress for clients.

We'd love to see you if you're a developer diving into WordPress, are building WordPress sites for client or are just wanting to take your knowledge of WordPress to the next level and are keen to get just that little bit more technical about what goes on under the hood.

Also? If you're looking for a developer to work with on a project, it's a great place to meet people and come and see if you can find a valuable connection here.

Hope to see you soon!
