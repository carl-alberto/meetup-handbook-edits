The WordPress [your-town] Meetup Group is for any WordPress user - new or experienced - who wants to learn more about WordPress, network with other users and developers and discuss all things WordPress.

We host three free meetups a month that address topics aimed at:

• Beginners just starting out.

• People using WordPress for their business and website.

• More experienced users who want to do more with WordPress.

• Technical-minded developers, designers and freelancers.

Regardless of whether you use WordPress as a developer, designer, business or blogger, our monthly meetups are sure to help you get the most out of this amazing open source software.

Thanks to our incredible sponsors, our meetups are free for you to attend.

We would love for you to be a part of our welcoming, active and enthusiastic group. So please join us and come along to the next event!
