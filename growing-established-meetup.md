### Growing an Established Meetup

One of the secrets to maintaining enthusiasm and momentum in your WordPress meetup is having a great team of people interested and enthusiastic about creating events and growing your group of WordPress members.

Some of the keys to identifying people who may make great organising team members are available on [our teams page](/building-growing-meetup/team.md)

As your group grows and the needs of the meetup start to grow as well, it may come time to support your meetup with quality sponsorship to help support the needs of your group. Of course, being a part of the Meetup Chapter Program will help support some of the initial expenses you may find. If you find yourself needing local sponsors as well, you can find some resources and information on the kinds of sponsors and [sponsorship arrangements that complement WordPress Meetup groups here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/05/07/meetup-sponsorships-and-other-local-community-stuff/).
